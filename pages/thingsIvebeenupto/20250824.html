                <hr>
                <br>
                <p>
                    It has been a while, and as usual, a lot has happened since my <a class="url" title="14/05/2025" href="20250514.html" target="_blank">last post</a>. 
                    I’ve been very busy, and only now have I finally found the time to share some news. Tomorrow students will 
                    start arriving at the boarding house, and that’s when my work truly begins. I’m very excited.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the beginning of July, I had my final Bachelor’s exam and it went really well. What didn’t go well, 
                    however, was my driving test the day before. In Switzerland you get about three attempts before being 
                    required to undergo a psychological assessment, after which you’re allowed more tries. I really wanted to get 
                    my license before starting work on August 18th, since it was technically a requirement for the job. During 
                    the interview, I had told my supervisors I was still working on it, but I was accepted anyway.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When my exam date came up, I felt I had a 50/50 chance of passing. Still, I wanted to use as many attempts as 
                    possible before the 18th. Rescheduling wasn’t an option—my mom had already booked a trip to Portugal, where I 
                    had scheduled the removal of some wisdom teeth. Unfortunately, I failed the test. That left me with two 
                    problems: my instructor would be on vacation after I returned, meaning I’d need a replacement teacher, and 
                    all test dates were booked until August 20th—too late for my job requirement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A few days later, I spent three weeks in Portugal. I traveled there by bus for the first time, and it was a 
                    terrible experience. The only activities that didn’t make me carsick were looking straight ahead, sleeping, 
                    eating, or listening to audiobooks. Thankfully, the return trip was by plane.
                </p>
                <p> On the day after we arrived in Coimbra, we went to Figueira da Foz and looked for a place to stay near the 
                    beach. We found one in Buarcos, owned by Mr. Miguel, a Portuguese man who had migrated to France during the 
                    Estado Novo dictatorship to avoid being drafted for the war in Africa.
                </p>
                <p> When he was about 18, his mother—after years of hard work—gave him a large sum of money and arranged for him 
                    to discreetly flee with a guide. That guide turned out to be a fugitive who had escaped prison after 
                    protesting the war by stripping naked during the <em>Juramento de Bandeira</em> ceremony. At the border 
                    between Spain and France, the guards demanded money to pass. Mr. Miguel reluctantly paid most of his savings, 
                    but soon after, the guide returned claiming he had negotiated free passage. Realizing the money was already 
                    gone, the guide smashed a wine bottle, threatened the guards, tied them up, and forced them to hand the money 
                    back. Mr. Miguel eventually made it to France safely, though he never saw the guide again. I should add that 
                    I may be misremembering some details of this story, but that’s how it stayed with me. Either way, it was one 
                    of the most striking stories I've ever heard.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first week in Portugal brought some good news: my driving instructor found me an exam date that someone 
                    else had canceled. In the second week, I had some of my wisdom teeth removed. The recovery was frustrating. 
                    My gums bled for a week and it was very hot. I don't usually mind the heat, but it wasn't ideal for my 
                    situation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I returned, I had to empty and disassemble my cabinets to prepare for moving into the boarding house on 
                    the 20th. In the meantime, I took lessons with another instructor. Unfortunately, on the 11th, I failed my 
                    second attempt at the license. This time, though, I’ve decided not to rush. I’ll only take the test again 
                    once I consistently pass practice simulations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After that failure, I procrastinated online, reading about driver’s licenses. I learned that Switzerland is 
                    one of the most expensive countries to get one—the average is around 3,600 CHF. I’ve already spent between 
                    7000 and 8000 CHF! Thankfully, I’ll soon have a salary, because my savings are nearly gone. Still, I can’t 
                    help being annoyed at these country-by-country inequalities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On a brighter note, I finally completed my blindfolded letter pairs list! The only letters I couldn’t fill 
                    were Q and X, so I adopted a Speffz color scheme where Q is replaced with Y and X with Z.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’ve also been working behind the scenes on <a title="Where the magic is done" href="pages/mathFromScratch.html" target="_blank">Math From Scratch</a>. 
                    I decided to rearrange the chapters. The reason is Gödel’s first incompleteness theorem, which requires some 
                    knowledge of set cardinality. Most of what’s already published will stay, but I want to emphasize the 
                    distinction between <em>truths of mathematics</em> and the <em>sentences we use to express them</em>. My 
                    current plan is to start with numbers and arithmetic, then move to naïve set theory, then informal axiomatic 
                    set theory, and only after the chapters on logic introduce formal set theory. To prepare, I’m reading three 
                    books at once: one on arithmetic, one on set theory, and one on mathematical logic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That’s about it, I think I’ve covered the main events. Next time, I should be writing about my experience at 
                    the boarding house and whether I finally pass my driving test (or end up facing the psychological assessment).
                    The suspense continues! See you in the next <s>episode</s> blog post.
