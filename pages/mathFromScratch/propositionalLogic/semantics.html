                    In this chapter, I'll define the semantics of our language. Since the formal logical connectives will keep 
                    the same meaning as our metalanguage's, I'll seize the opportunity to clarify our metalanguage by precising 
                    what is meant by "and", "or" and other usual connectives. After that, I'll present some properties of those 
                    connectives, define truth functions and explain how to build any truth function with our connectives.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2> <u>Definitions: truth tables</u> </h2>
                <p>
                    The semantics of propositional logic revolves around the truth values of wffs. I'll denote the truth value 
                    "true" by "\(\mathcal{T}\)" and the truth value "false" by "\(\mathcal{F}\)". "\(\mathcal{T}\)" and 
                    "\(\mathcal{F}\)" are said to be opposites from one another. One defines the meaning of any logical 
                    connective by settling the truth value of the compound statement for each combination of truth values of the 
                    substastement/s the connective applies to. This is usually done via a truth table, which enumerates all 
                    possibilities for the truth/falsity of the substatement/s.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Negation is denoted by the symbol \(\neg\). When negation is applied to a wff, the resulting statement takes 
                    the opposite value of its substatement. Its truth table is
                </p>
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <th>\(A\)</th>
                        <th>\(\neg A\)</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>\(\mathcal{F}\)</td>
                        <td>\(\mathcal{T}\)</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>\(\mathcal{T}\)</td>

                <p>
                    The <em>and</em> connective, also called conjunction, is denoted by the symbol \(\land\). Conjunction is true 
                    if and only if both substatements are true and is false otherwise. The order in which the substatements 
                    appear is irrelevant (for example, "he fell and he got up" doesn't necessarily mean that first he fell and 
                    then he got up). Its truth table is
                </p>

                <p>
                    The <em>or</em> connective, also called disjunction, is denoted by the symbol \(\lor\). Disjunction is false 
                    if and only if both substatements are false and is true otherwise. Notice that by <em>or</em>, I mean the 
                    <em>inclusive or</em>: \(A\) or \(B\) is also true when both \(A\) and \(B\) are true, whereas in English, by 
                    <em>or</em> we usually mean the exclusive one, in which \(A\) or \(B\) is instead false when both \(A\) and 
                    \(B\) are true. In Mathematics in general (as well as in Math From Scratch), when <em>or</em> is used, the 
                    inclusive <em>or</em> is meant. Thus, in our context, "or" is the same as "and/or". Its truth table is

                Implication is an interesting one, as many people find its truth table unintuitive. <em>Implies</em> is denoted 
                by the symbol \(\rightarrow\). In the expression \(A \rightarrow B\), \(A\) is called the hypothesis and \(B\) is 
                called the conclusion. \(A \rightarrow B\) is false if and only if the hypothesis \(A\) is true and the 
                conclusion \(B\) is false. Otherwise, it's true. Its truth table is
