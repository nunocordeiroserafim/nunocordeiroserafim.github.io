                    In this chapter, I'll define the semantics of our language. Since the formal logical connectives will keep 
                    the same meaning as our metalanguage's, I'll seize the opportunity to clarify our metalanguage by specifying 
                    what is meant by "and", "or" and other usual connectives.
                </p>

                <h2> <u>Truth tables</u> </h2>
                <p>
                    The semantics of propositional logic revolves around the truth values of wffs. I'll denote the truth value 
                    "true" by "\(\mathcal{T}\)" and the truth value "false" by "\(\mathcal{F}\)". "\(\mathcal{T}\)" and 
                    "\(\mathcal{F}\)" are said to be opposites from one another. One defines the meaning of any logical 
                    connective by settling the truth value of the compound statement for each combination of truth values of the 
                    substastement/s the connective applies to. This is usually done via a truth table, which enumerates all 
                    possibilities for the truth/falsity of the substatement/s.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the following definitions, the letters \(A\) and \(B\) are metavariables.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Negation is denoted by the symbol \(\neg\). When negation is applied to a wff, the resulting statement takes 
                    the opposite value of its substatement. Its truth table is
                </p>

                    <tr>
                        <th>\(A\)</th>
                        <th>\(\neg A\)</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>\(\mathcal{F}\)</td>

                    The <em>and</em> connective, also called conjunction, is denoted by the symbol \(\land\). Conjunction is true 
                    if and only if both substatements are true and is false otherwise. The order in which the substatements 
                    appear is irrelevant (for example, "he fell and he got up" doesn't necessarily mean that first he fell and 
                    then he got up). Its truth table is

                <p>
                    The <em>or</em> connective, also called disjunction, is denoted by the symbol \(\lor\). Disjunction is false 
                    if and only if both substatements are false and is true otherwise. Notice that by <em>or</em>, I mean the 
                    <em>inclusive or</em>: \(A\) or \(B\) is also true when both \(A\) and \(B\) are true, whereas in English, by 
                    <em>or</em> we usually mean the exclusive one, in which \(A\) or \(B\) is instead false when both \(A\) and 
                    \(B\) are true. In Mathematics in general (as well as in Math From Scratch), when <em>or</em> is used, the 
                    inclusive <em>or</em> is meant. Thus, in our context, "or" is the same as "and/or". Its truth table is

                    Implication is an interesting one, as many people find its truth table unintuitive. <em>Implies</em> is 
                    denoted by the symbol \(\rightarrow\). In the expression \(A \rightarrow B\), \(A\) is called the hypothesis 
                    and \(B\) is called the conclusion. \(A \rightarrow B\) is false if and only if the hypothesis \(A\) is true 
                    and the conclusion \(B\) is false. Otherwise, it's true. Its truth table is

                <p>
                    If you think that when \(A\) is false, then \(A \rightarrow B\) should be false, then you are likely 
                    confusing \(A \rightarrow B\) with \(A \land (A \rightarrow B)\). One is saying "if \(A\), then \(B\)" and 
                    the other "\(A\), so \(B\)", which is the same as just saying "\(A\) and \(B\)". Indeed, if you were to 
                    define \(A \rightarrow B\) as being false when \(A\) is false, you would get the same truth table as 
                    \(A \land B\).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The reason that \(A \rightarrow B\) is true whenever \(A\) is false is that one should interpret wffs as 
                    rules that are true whenever they are satisfied and false otherwise. Let's illustrate this with two examples.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Imagine you have four cards, each containing a letter on one side and a number on the other. Now suppose you 
                    can only see their front side and that they are labelled "A", "B", "5" and "6". Which card/s do you need to 
                    turn to check that the rule "If there is an A on one side of the card, then there is definitely a 5 on the 
                    other" is satisfied?
                </p>
                <p>
                    If your answer is A and 5, you are wrong! You do indeed need to turn card A to check whether there is a 5 on 
                    the other side, but you do not need to turn card 5 to check whether there is an A on the other, as the rule 
                    doesn't specify which letter should be on the other side for a 5. The answer to this question is instead card 
                    A <em>and</em> card 6, as if there were to be an A on the other side of card 6, then the rule wouldn't be 
                    satisfied.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In case you are still a bit confused about this, here's a second example: You are at a bar which has the rule 
                    that anyone under 18 cannot drink alcohol. There are four people at the bar, all drinking something: the 
                    first person is 16 years old, the second is 24 years old, the third is drinking water and the fourth is 
                    drinking a beer. Which people should you "investigate" to check that the bar's rule isn't being broken? 
                    Clearly you do not care about the person who's 24 nor the one who's drinking water. You do however need to 
                    check the 16 year old as well as the person drinking beer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Remark that those two examples are equivalent, with the differences that in one we have letters/numbers 
                    whereas in the other we have the age/drink. The first person is like card A, the second like card B, the 
                    third like card 5 and the fourth like card 6.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think that a source of many people's confusion comes from their thinking that there should be some causal 
                    link between the hypothesis and the conclusion. "If pigs can fly, then Lisbon is the capital of Portugal" is 
                    true, because the rule is always satisfied. Pigs can't fly (at least as far as I'm aware), so whichever the 
                    conclusion, the implication is true, even though there is no link between the flying ability of pigs and the 
                    city that's Portugal's capital. In the same way, "if the sky is blue, then the Rubik's Cube was invented by 
                    Ernő Rubik" is true because that rule is satisfied, but "if Darth Vader is Luke Skywalker's father, then I 
                    (the author, not necessarily you) am the fastest speedcuber ever" is false, because Luke is Vader's son, but 
                    I'm definitely not the best speedcuber ever.

                    The reverse implication \(A \leftarrow B\) is an implication in which \(A\) is the conclusion and \(B\) is 
                    the hypothesis. \(A \leftarrow B\) is called the reciprocal of \(A \rightarrow B\). Thus, its truth table is

                    Equivalence is denoted by the symbol \(\leftrightarrow\). The meaning of \(A \leftrightarrow B\) is the same 
                    as \((A \rightarrow B) \land (A \leftarrow B)\). Thus, if you check the truth tables of \(A \rightarrow B\) 
                    and \(A \leftarrow B\) and apply the definition of <em>and</em>, you get

                    What is meant by taking the conjunction, the disjunction, the implication, or whatever other application of 
                    a binary logical connective \(\circ\) to \(n\) metavariables (at least 2) ranging from \(A_1\) to \(A_n\), is

                    With those definitions in place, we are now in position to evaluate the truth value of a wff given an 
                    assignment of either \(\mathcal{T}\) or \(\mathcal{F}\) to each individual metavariable:

                        Given evaluated subwffs, evaluate the compound wffs created from them by the binding of logical 
                        connectives by checking the corresponding row in the truth table for the respective connective

                <h2> <u>Some abbreviation notation for the metalanguage</u> </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes, instead of writing "If \(A\), then \(B\)" or "\(A\) implies \(B\)", I may write 
                    "\(A \Rightarrow B\)". Also, instead of writing "\(A\) is equivalent to \(B\)" or "\(A\) iff \(B\)", I may 
                    write "\(A\) iff \(B\)" or "\(A \Leftrightarrow B\)". For propositional logic, saying \(A \Leftrightarrow B\) 
                    means that \(A\) and \(B\) have the same truth table, i.e. that all values of \(A \leftrightarrow B\)'s truth 
                    table's final column are true.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Do not mistake the symbols \(\Rightarrow\) and \(\Leftrightarrow\) for \(\rightarrow\) and \(\leftrightarrow\). 
                    The first two belong to the metalanguage, even though they have the same meaning as the object language's!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'll be making an exception though, where the meanings of \(\Rightarrow\) and \(\Leftrightarrow\) will be 
                    different than \(\rightarrow\) and \(\leftrightarrow\). When writing various successions of metalanguage's 
                    implications or equivalences \(\bigcomp\limits_{i=1}^{n}A_i\), where \(\circ\) stands for the symbol 
                    \(\Rightarrow\) or \(\Leftrightarrow\), possibly mixed, instead of having the same meaning as when \(\circ\) 
                    stands for \(\rightarrow\) or \(\leftrightarrow\), it will mean 
                    \(\left(\bigwedge\limits_{i=1}^{n-1}A_i\right) \circ A_n\).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since the metalanguage's goal is to communicate ideas informally, I might be loose in the use of those 
                    metalinguistical symbols by adding dashes on top of them to indicate their negation or by writing things like 
                </p>

                    Remark that for that last statement, the commas in the sentence "\(A \Rightarrow B\), and 
                    \(A \not\Rightarrow C\), and \(B \Leftrightarrow C\)" are intended to indicate that the "and" has a lower 
                    precendence that the other connectives, as without them, the sentence would mean "\(A \Rightarrow \)(\(B\) 
                    and \(A\)) \(\not\Rightarrow \) (\(C\) and \(B\)) \(\Leftrightarrow C\)".
