                    A function is a fundamental mathematical concept. It is an assignment of one element of a set called the 
                    codomain/range to another set called the domain. You can think of it as an abstract machine that takes inputs, 
                    returns outputs and that for any input, a single output is returned. The inputs are also called the function 
                    arguments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You might be aware, especially if you already are familiar with set theory, that this is an informal 
                    definition. Indeed, we are going to assume the function concept as part of our metalanguage, but of course, 
                    this won't prevent us from rigorously defining what a function is in our formal theory later on. Also, do not 
                    fret if you are familiar with the paradoxes from set theory. Here we did use the concept of a set, but 
                    nothing crazy was done. I'm assuming this is a concept of our informal metalanguage and once we formally 
                    develop set theory, you may come back and realize that everything's fine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A truth function is a function that has at least one input and a single output. Both inputs and output take 
                    in truth values. In propositional logic, a truth function is defined by a truth table, where one lists all 
                    the truth value combinations that its arguments can take as well as their respective output value. As we saw 
                    in <a style="color: var(--url-color)" title="Definitions" href="definitions.html">2.2.1 Definitions</a>, 
                    truth tables are used to determine all the truth values that a wff can take. Thus, you may view wffs as truth 
                    functions whose arguments are the most basic subformulas and whose output takes the wff's truth value.
                </p>
                <p>One of the things that we are going to do in this chapter is to find wffs whose truth tables correspond to any 
                    given truth function by providing an algorithm to do so, but first, let's talk about the De Morgan's laws, 
                    which will be useful for our discussion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let \(A_k\) be metavariables. The De Morgan's laws state that 
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        \(\neg\bigwedge\limits_{k=1}^nA_k \Leftrightarrow \bigvee\limits_{k=1}^n\neg A_k\), i.e. the negation of 
                        conjunctions is equivalent to the disjunction of negations
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        \(\neg\bigvee\limits_{k=1}^nA_k \Leftrightarrow \bigwedge\limits_{k=1}^n\neg A_k\), i.e. the negation of 
                        disjunctions is equivalent to the conjunction of negations
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    To check this, it suffices to draw the respective truth tables for two metavariables \(A\) and \(B\):

                    <span style="font-size: 17pt;"><u><strong>Proposition:</strong></u></span> Every truth function can be 
                    generated by a wff involving only the connectives \(\neg\), \(\land\) and \(\lor\).
                </p>
                <p> <span style="font-size: 17pt;"><strong>Proof:</strong></span> </p>
                <p>
                    Consider the wff created by the following procedure. Given a truth function, do the following for each of its
                    rows whose output is true:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Make an ordered list of wffs \(U_{ij}\), such that \(U_{ij}\) is \(A_j\) if the \(j^\text{th}\) value of 
                        the \(i^\text{th}\) row is true and is \(\neg A_j\) if the \(j^\text{th}\) value of the \(i^\text{th}\) 
                        row is false
                    </li>
                    <li> Let \(C_i\) be the conjunction of all these \(U_{ij}\) </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    The wff that I want you to consider is the disjunction of all \(C_i\), which I'll call \(D\). Remark that the 
                    only symbols it contains are \(\neg\), \(\land\) and \(\lor\). Now I'm going to prove that the truth table of 
                    that wff is exactly the truth table of the given truth function.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each \(C_i\)'s truth table is such that all of its outputs are false except for the \(i^\text{th}\) row. The 
                    reason is that for each \(C_i\), because of the way that each \(U_{ij}\) was defined, whenever \(A_j\) is 
                    true, \(U_{ij}\) is true and whenever \(A_j\) is false, \(U_{ij}\) is again true. Thus, the output of 
                    \(C_i\)'s truth table is necessarily true for the \(i^\text{th}\) row. For any other row however, there will 
                    be a column for which at least one of the \(U_{ij}\) is false, so for any row other than the \(i^\text{th}\), 
                    \(C_i\)'s output will be false (as conjunction is false iff at least one of its closest subformulas is false).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Therefore, since the disjunction is true when at least one of its closest subformulas is true and false when 
                    all its closest subformulas are false, \(D\)'s truth table is exactly the same as the given function's!

                <p>
                    <u><strong>Remark:</strong></u> If you think about it, what the algorithm from the above proof tells is that 
                    saying "\(A\)" is the same as saying "\(A\) is true"

                <p>
                    The wff obtained from the proof's algorithm contains disjunctions of conjunctions. Such wffs are said to be 
                    in disjunctive normal form. The more rows for which the truth function evaluates to \(\mathcal{T}\) its truth 
                    table contains, the longest its disjunctive normal form formula is going to be. Thus, if its truth table 
                    contains more true rows than false ones, the following algorithm will produce a shorter wff:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Given a truth function, do the following for each of its rows whose output is false:</li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Make an ordered list of wffs \(U_{ij}\), such that \(U_{ij}\) is \(A_j\) if the \(j^\text{th}\) value 
                            of the \(i^\text{th}\) row is true and is \(\neg A_j\) if the \(j^\text{th}\) value of the 
                            \(i^\text{th}\) row is false
                        </li>
                        <li> Let \(C_i\) be the conjunction of all these \(U_{ij}\) </li>
                    </ol>
                    <li>Let \(D\) the negation of the disjunction of all \(C_i\)</li>
                    <li>
                        The final wff is the one obtained by applying the De Morgan's laws to \(D\) and to each of its \(C_i\)
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    In step 2., if we were to simply consider the disjunction of all \(C_i\), this would be the same algorithm 
                    that we used to create the disjunctive normal form wff, but for the truth table whose values of the final 
                    column would be opposite, as the \(C_i\) would only be taken from rows that evaluate to false. That's why the 
                    negation of the disjunction of all \(C_i\) was taken.
                </p>

                    <u><strong>Remark:</strong></u> This could have been stated as a theorem. In fact, many informations that are 
                    transmitted in the mathematical literature could be stated as theorems, but since communication is usually 
                    done in a informal metalanguage, the proofs are informal and it's up to the author to decide whether to write 
                    statements as theorems or simply to discuss them

                <p>
                    This new wff contains conjunctions of disjunctions, so it's said to be in conjunctive normal form.
