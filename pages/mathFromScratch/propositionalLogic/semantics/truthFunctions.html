                    A function is a fundamental mathematical concept. It is an assignment of one element of a set called the 
                    codomain/range to another set called the domain. You can think of it as an abstract machine that takes inputs, 
                    returns outputs and that for any input, a single output is returned. The inputs are also called the function 
                    arguments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You might be aware, especially if you already are familiar with set theory, that this is an informal 
                    definition. Indeed, we are going to assume the function concept as part of our metalanguage, but of course, 
                    this won't prevent us from rigorously defining what a function is in our formal theory later on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A truth function is a function that has at least one input and a single output. Both inputs and output take 
                    in truth values. In propositional logic, a truth function is defined by a truth table, where one lists all 
                    the truth value combinations that its arguments can take as well as their respective output value. As we saw 
                    in <a style="color: var(--url-color)" title="Definitions" href="definitions.html">2.1 Definitions</a>, truth 
                    tables are used to determine all the truth values that a wff can take. Thus, you may view wffs as truth 
                    functions, whose arguments are most basic subformulas and whose output takes the wff's truth value. One of 
                    the things that we are going to do in this chapter is to find wffs whose truth tables correspond to any given 
                    truth function by providing an algorithm to do so.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1em;">
                    <span style="font-size: 17pt;"><u><strong>Proposition:</strong></u></span> Every truth function can be 
                    generated by a wff involving only the connectives \(\neg\), \(\land\) and \(\lor\).
                </p>
                <p> <span style="font-size: 17pt;"><strong>Proof:</strong></span> </p>
                <p>
                    Let \(f\) denote the given truth function of \(n\) arguments, which are denoted by \(x_j\), with \(j\) from 1 
                    to \(n\). Let \(A_j\) be the most basic wffs of \(f\)'s truth table, i.e. the subformulas that correspond to 
                    its arguments.
