                    A function is a fundamental mathematical concept. It is an assignment of one element of a set called the 
                    codomain/range to another set called the domain. You can think of it as an abstract machine that takes inputs, 
                    returns outputs and that for any input, a single output is returned. The inputs are also called the function 
                    arguments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You might be aware, especially if you already are familiar with set theory, that this is an informal 
                    definition. Indeed, we are going to assume the function concept as part of our metalanguage, but of course, 
                    this won't prevent us from rigorously defining what a function is in our formal theory later on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A truth function is a function that has at least one input and a single output. Both inputs and output take 
                    in truth values. In propositional logic, a truth function is defined by a truth table, where one lists all 
                    the truth value combinations that its arguments can take as well as their respective output value. As we saw 
                    in <a style="color: var(--url-color)" title="Definitions" href="definitions.html">2.1 Definitions</a>, truth 
                    tables are used to determine all the truth values that a wff can take. Thus, you may view wffs as truth 
                    functions, whose arguments are most basic subformulas and whose output takes the wff's truth value. One of 
                    the things that we are going to do in this chapter is to find wffs whose truth tables correspond to any given 
                    truth function by providing an algorithm to do so.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1em;">
                    <span style="font-size: 17pt;"><u><strong>Proposition:</strong></u></span> Every truth function can be 
                    generated by a wff involving only the connectives \(\neg\), \(\land\) and \(\lor\).
                </p>
                <p> <span style="font-size: 17pt;"><strong>Proof:</strong></span> </p>
                <p>
                    Consider the wff created by the following procedure. Given a truth function, do the following for each of its
                    rows whose output is true:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Make an ordered list of wffs \(U_{ij}\), such that \(U_{ij}\) is \(A_j\) if the \(j^\text{th}\) value of 
                        the \(i^\text{th}\) row is true and is \(\neg A_j\) if the \(j^\text{th}\) value of the \(i^\text{th}\) 
                        row is false
                    </li>
                    <li> Let \(C_i\) be the conjunction of all these \(U_{ij}\) </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    The wff that I want you to consider is the disjunction of all \(C_i\), which I'll call \(D\). Remark that the 
                    only symbols it contains are \(\neg\), \(\land\) and \(\lor\). Now I'm going to prove that the truth table of 
                    that wff is exactly the truth table of the given truth function.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each \(C_i\)'s truth table is such that all of its outputs are false except for the \(i^\text{th}\) row. The 
                    reason is that for each \(C_i\), because of the way that each \(U_{ij}\) was defined, whenever \(A_j\) is 
                    true, \(U_{ij}\) is true and whenever \(A_j\) is false, \(U_{ij}\) is again true. Thus, the output of 
                    \(C_i\)'s truth table is necessarily true for the \(i^\text{th}\) row. For any other row however, there will 
                    be a column for which at least one of the \(U_{ij}\) is false, so for any row other than the \(i^\text{th}\), 
                    \(C_i\)'s output will be false (as conjunction is false iff at least one of its closest subformulas is false).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Therefore, since the disjunction is true when at least one of its closest subformulas is true and false when 
                    all its closest subformulas are false, \(D\)'s truth table is exactly the same as the given function's!
                </p>
