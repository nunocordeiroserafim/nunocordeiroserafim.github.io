                    From Euclid's time until the 19th century (with the publication of <a class="url" href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/EuclidsPostulates.html" target="_blank">Frege's Begriffsschrift</a>), 
                    "axioms were stated in a natural language (eg. Greek, English, etc.), and proofs were just given in "ordinary
                    reasoning"; exactly what a proof <em>is</em> was not formally analyzed. This is still the case now in most 
                    mathematics. Logical symbols are frequently used as abbreviations of English words, but most math books 
                    assume that you can recognize a correct proof when you see it, without formal analysis." - quote from Kenneth
                    Kunen from his book <em>The Foundations of Mathematics</em>.

                <h2> <u>Formal system</u> </h2>
                <p>
                    In <a style="color: var(--url-color)" title="The Very Beginning" href="theVeryBeginning.html">0. The Very Beginning</a>,
                    I've mentioned that we need to communicate without ambiguity. A way to achieve such clarity is through the 
                    use of a formal system, which will allow us to derive formal proofs. Formal proofs are simply proofs written 
                    in a specific form, following a given syntax. A formal system is a <em>formal language</em> equipped with a 
                    <em>deductive apparatus</em>.
                </p>
                </p>
                    A <strong>formal language</strong> consists of formulas formed from an <em>alphabet</em> and a 
                    <em>grammar</em>. An <strong>alphabet</strong> is a set of indivisible symbols/letters/tokens/characters. For 
                    example, if we were to create an alphabet for the decimal number system, the alphabet would consist of the 
                    digit symbols "0", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8" and "9", as well as the relation symbols "\(<\)", 
                    "\(>\)" and "\(=\)". By concatenating the alphabet's symbols, one creates strings. Among the strings, words 
                    are the ones that are described by the <strong>grammar</strong> according to its formation rules. In the 
                    previous example, the only formation rules are that digit symbols are words and that any concatenation of a 
                    word with a digit symbol forms a new word. By concatenating words with relation symbols, one creates formulas. 
                    Among formulas, well-formed formulas (or wffs for short) also follow the grammar's respective formation rules. 
                    For our very primitive decimal number system language, formulas could simply be a word followed by a relation 
                    symbol followed by another word.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Given a formal language, one may go on to do two things:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Explore the semantics by defining an interpretation of the language, which is an assignment of meaning to 
                        its symbols
                    </li>
                    <li>Specify a deductive apparatus for the language, which takes us down the road of proof theory</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    At first we will mainly focus on the latter. A <strong>deductive apparatus</strong> consists of wffs called 
                    axioms and inference rules/rules of inference. By definition, the theorems of a formal system are the axioms 
                    and all wffs derived from the inference rules.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thus, proofs are pure mechanical manipulations of symbols, with no regard whatsoever to their meaning. When 
                    dealing with syntax, you <strong>must</strong> abstract from the semantics. Ignore this warning at your own 
                    peril.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've recently come across an excellent example about the distinction between syntax and semantics. In the 
                    movie <strong>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3</strong>, as the guardians are infiltrating the Orgosphere, 
                    Star-Lord has an embarrassing talk with Gamora. He is eventually interrupted by his teammates who point out 
                    that he's talking on an open line and they have been listening to everything. They then go on arguing about 
                    which button does what. Their interaction goes like this:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li style="list-style-type: none;">Mantis: <em>What color button did you push?</em></li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: none;">
                        Star-Lord: <em>Blue, for the blue suit!</em> (they were wearing suits of different colors and Gamora's 
                        was blue)
                    </li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: none;">Drax: <em>Oh, no!</em></li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: none;">Nebula: <em>Blue is the open line for everyone.</em></li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: none;">Mantis: <em>Orange is for blue.</em></li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: none;">Star-Lord: <em>What?</em></li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: none;">
                        Mantis: <em>Black is for orange, yellow is for green, green is for red and red is for yellow.</em>
                    </li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: none;">
                        Drax: <em>No, yellow is for yellow, green is for red, red is for green.</em>
                    </li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: none;">Mantis: <em>I don't think so.</em></li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: none;">Drax: <em>Try it then.</em></li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: none;">[Mantis clicks on yellow]</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: none;">Mantis: <em>HELLO!</em> (deafening everyone)</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: none;">Mantis: <em>You were right.</em></li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: none;">Star-Lord: <em>How the hell am I supposed to know all of that?</em></li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: none;">Drax: <em>Seems intuitive.</em></li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h2> <u>The game of Chess</u> </h2>
                <p>
                    To give an example, let's define a formal system for the game of <a class="url" title="Rules of Chess" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_of_chess" target="_blank"><strong>Chess</strong></a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Its alphabet consists of the pieces (Pawn, Bishop, Knight, Rook, Queen and King, black and white), of the 
                    game board and of the informations of whose turn it is, of whether each player may castle if the opportunity 
                    presents, of how many times each position has been visited (for the repetition rule) and of how many moves 
                    have been made since a Pawn has been moved or a capture has been made (for the 50 and 75-move rules). Its 
                    words are the pieces, and its wffs are allocations of pieces to the game board with flags containing the 
                    informations above.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The only axiom is the starting position, with White to move, both players being allowed to castle if the 
                    opportunity presents, no visited position except once for the starting one, and no made moves since last 
                    capture or Pawn move. The rules of inference are simply the rules of the game, which from a given position 
                    indicate which positions can be reached in the next move. Thus, the theorems are simply the starting position, 
                    as well as all positions that arise from the inference rules.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You may have noticed that I kind of cheated, because a formal system was supposed to work with symbols, 
                    whereas here I've instead used pieces, informations, board positions, etc. However, it should be clear that 
                    one may may make this a proper formal system by associating symbols to each piece, relation symbols to 
                    indicate where each piece stands on the board, logical connectives to allow one to say "the Pawn is in C3 
                    <em>and</em> the Rook is in H1", etc. In other words, you may create a formal system for the game of chess if 
                    you reverse-engineer the semantics.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2> <u>Rigorous proof</u> </h2>
                <p>
                    If you formally prove something, meaning by using a formal system, then it will rigorously be proven. It 
                    doesn't mean however, that any proof conducted outside of a formal system isn't rigorous. Indeed, when we'll 
                    be studying mathematical logic in the next few chapters, we'll be analyzing formal systems by proving 
                    theorems about them. Such theorems are called metatheorems, as they are proven outside of the formal systems 
                    and provide insights about them. Metatheorems will be informally but rigorously proven in our metalanguage 
                    (English).
                </p>
                <p>
                    But what does rigorous mean? That's a tricky question. Any formal proof is objectively rigorous. An informal 
                    proof on the other hand is rigorous only as long as it justifies the conclusion. Unfortunately, what might be 
                    considered as a satisfying justification to some may be unsatisfying to others, thus making the concept of 
                    rigor subjective. To surpass that issue, metaproofs will reference definitions, which will act as axioms if 
                    you will, and be mainly constructive by providing algorithms (=step-by-step instructions) for arriving at 
                    the desired conclusions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One could also make metaproofs formal (and thus objectively rigorous) by creating a formal system for them, 
                    but then the same problem would appear for the metametalaguage of the formalized metalanguage. Thus, it isn't 
                    a worthy endeavour.
