                    From Euclid's time until the 19th century (with the publication of <a class="url" href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/EuclidsPostulates.html" target="_blank">Frege's Begriffsschrift</a>), 
                    "axioms were stated in a natural language (eg. Greek, English, etc.), and proofs were just given in "ordinary
                    reasoning"; exactly what a proof <em>is</em> was not formally analyzed. This is still the case now in most 
                    mathematics. Logical symbols are frequently used as abbreviations of English words, but most math books 
                    assume that you can recognize a correct proof when you see it, without formal analysis." - quote from Kenneth
                    Kunen from his book <em>The Foundations of Mathematics</em>.

                    I've mentioned that we need to communicate without ambiguity. A way to achieve such clarity is through the 
                    use of a formal system. We will define a formal language, with its own symbols and precise rules to form 
                    terms (=words), from which one then builds well-formed formulas (=sentences/statements). A formal proof is 
                    then a finite sequence of well-formed formulas in this formal language obeying some precisely defined 
                    axioms/axiom schemes and rules of inference. Thus, a theorem is treated as a string, i.e. a sequence of 
                    characters/symbols, and a proof is a mere mechanical manipulation of symbols, with no reference whatsoever to 
                    their meaning. This is the difference between <strong>syntax</strong> and <strong>semantics</strong>. Syntax 
                    deals only with symbols whereas semantics deals with their meaning. When dealing with syntax, you 
                    <strong>must</strong> ignore the semantics. Ignore this warning at your own peril.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've recently come across an excellent example about the distinction between syntax and semantics. In 
                    <strong>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3</strong>, as the guardians are infiltrating the Orgosphere, Star-Lord 
                    has an embarrassing talk with Gamora. He is eventually interrupted by his teammates who point out that he's 
                    talking on an open line and they have been listening to everything. They then go on arguing about which 
                    button does what. Their interaction goes like this:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li style="list-style-type: none;">Mantis: <em>What color button did you push?</em></li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: none;">
                        Star-Lord: <em>Blue, for the blue suit!</em> (they were wearing suits of different colors and Gamora's 
                        was blue)
                    </li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: none;">Drax: <em>Oh, no!</em></li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: none;">Nebula: <em>Blue is the open line for everyone.</em></li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: none;">Mantis: <em>Orange is for blue.</em></li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: none;">Star-Lord: <em>What?</em></li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: none;">
                        Mantis: <em>Black is for orange, yellow is for green, green is for red and red is for yellow.</em>
                    </li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: none;">
                        Drax: <em>No, yellow is for yellow, green is for red, red is for green.</em>
                    </li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: none;">Mantis: <em>I don't think so.</em></li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: none;">Drax: <em>Try it then.</em></li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: none;">[Mantis clicks on yellow]</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: none;">Mantis: <em>HELLO!</em> (deafening everyone)</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: none;">Mantis: <em>You were right.</em></li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: none;">Star-Lord: <em>How the hell am I supposed to know all of that?</em></li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: none;">Drax: <em>Seems intuitive.</em></li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Anyway, getting back to the subject at hand, if you formally prove something, meaning by using a formal 
                    system, then it will be rigorously proven. It doesn't mean however, that any proof conducted outside of a 
                    formal system isn't rigorous. Indeed, when we'll be studying mathematical logic in the next few chapters, 
                    we'll be analyzing formal systems by proving theorems about them. Such theorems are called metatheorems, as 
                    they are proven outside of the formal systems and provide insights about them. Metatheorems will be 
                    informally but rigorously proven in our metalanguage (English).
                </p>
                <p>
                    But what does rigorous mean? That's a tricky question. Any formal proof is objectively rigorous. An informal 
                    proof on the other hand is rigorous only as long as it justifies the conclusion. Unfortunately, what might be 
                    considered as a satisfying justification to some may be unsatisfying to others, thus making the concept of 
                    rigor subjective. To surpass that issue, metaproofs will reference definitions, which will act as axioms if 
                    you will, and be mainly constructive by providing algorithms (=step-by-step instructions) for arriving at 
                    the desired conclusions.
                </p>

                    If you are still unclear about what formal proofs look like, it's normal, because they will only be defined
