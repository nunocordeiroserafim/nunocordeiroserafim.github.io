                <p>For a while now (at the very least since 2019, at most since 2014), I've been wanting to prove all the mathematical knowledge (theorems and algorithms) that I've learned. If you were to learn Mathematics from the very beginning, how would you go about it? If you want to make sure something is true, you should be able to trace it back to the axioms, the elementary blocks that you assume to be true, instead of merely blindly believing the source.</p>
                <p> This is my attempt at this challenge. I would like to rigorously derive all my current mathematical toolset and make my way up to my favorite topics, like Game Theory.</p>
